Fragment Shader Architecture

The architecture consists of a large pipeline, consisting of a number of vector and scalar units which can be enabled and disabled by the control word. In particular, there are two vector ALU's, one of which can do addition, another which can do multiplication. There are also two similar scalar ALU's, and the "combiner" capable of executing scalar-vector multiplies as well as various complex/transcdental functions (sqrt, rcp, sin, cos, exp2, etc.). Furthermore, there are varying, uniform/temporary, and texture load units, a temporary store unit, and a branching unit for implementing jumps. Each unit can affect/produce results which are used by all later units, as if all 6 registers are passed between each unit in the pipeline (see "Lima Fragment Pipeline" below). The only exception is that each vector ALU unit is executed in parallel with its scalar counterpart - so the vector and scalar multiply ALU's run in parallel, and so do the vector and scalar addition ALU's. Furthermore, to reduce register pressure, there are a number of "pipeline registers". A pipeline register is a direct connection between two units in the pipeline, in addition to the normal registers which are passed between every unit. For more details on registers (including pipeline registers), see the "Registers" section below. To overcome the pipeline stall issues inherent in such a long pipeline (128 stages for Mali-200, see this page), the architecture is likely barrelled and interleaves execution of a large number of fragments at once, and scheduling is done by the machine in order to minimize stalls. The instruction stream is compressed down from a maximum of 18-words per instruction dependant on what units are in use. The remaining bits give each unit individual instructions and constants.

The encodings are variable length 32-bit aligned.
Control Word Encoding

Fragment shaders begin with a 32-bit control word. The control word dictates what units will be used in each instruction. The lowest 5 bits of the control word determines the number 32-bit DWORDs in the entire instruction "word" (including the control word).
Speculation on derivatives

Apparently, most GPU's processes fragments in groups of 2x2; I suspect ours does this as well. Normally, each shader in the group is contained from one another, except for derivatives. Derivatives are an extension in gles 2.0 (OES_standard_derivatives), however Mali does support it. Usually, derivatives are accomplished by each pixel swapping the value passed into the function with either it's vertical (dFdy) or horizontal (dFdx) neighbor in the group, and then computing the difference with it's own value. Furthermore, all 4 shaders have to execute this swap-and-difference instruction at once; I believe control bit 6 synchronizes the shaders (I'm not sure what happens when each shader takes a different side of a branch). Bit 6 is enabled for texture fetching because the processor computes the level of detail by computing the screen-space derivative of the texture coordinates, and therefore needs to compute derivatives as part of fetching the texture.
Bitfield Description

 0...4: {  } Instruction Length
 5:     {0 } Output to gl_FragColor and end program.
 6:     {0 } Inter-thread synchronization?
 7:     {34} Varying Fetch
 8:     {62} Texture Sampler
 9:     {41} Uniform/Temporary Fetch
10:     {43} Vec4 Multiply ALU
11:     {30} Scalar Multiply ALU
12:     {44} Vec4 Addition ALU
13:     {31} Scalar Addition ALU
14:     {30} Vec4-Scalar Multiply/Transcendental Scalar ALU
15:     {41} Temporary Write/Framebuffer Read
16:     {73} Branch/Discard
17:     {64} Vec4 Constant Fetch 0
18:     {64} Vec4 Constant Fetch 1
19..24: {  } Next Instruction Length (prefetch)
25:     {  } Prefetch enable
28..31  {  } Unknown (=0)


{n} means this bit set adds n bits to the instruction 

Prefetch enable is set for all instructions which can possibly reach the next instruction, i.e. all instructions except for the last instruction and discard instructions. For all instructions, the next instruction length is set to the instruction length of the next instruction (duh) except for the last instruction where it's set to 0; presumably this is for prefetching, since it will work if you set a too high value for this field but it will crash if you set a value too low. If you add the n's together for each enabled unit, and then round upward to the nearest 32-bit word, (+1 word for the control word) they should equal the bottom 5 bits.
Vector Swizzling

These 8 bits encode how to swizzle a 4-component vector in the vec4 addition and multiplication opcodes.The bits are grouped into 4 groups of 2. Bits 0 and 1 tell what goes in the first element, 2 and 3 what goes in the second element, etc. For example:

 00 = 00 00 00 00 = .xxxx
 04 = 00 00 01 00 = .xyxx
 10 = 00 01 00 00 = .xxyx
 14 = 00 01 01 00 = .xyyx
 24 = 00 10 01 00 = .xyzx
 40 = 01 00 00 00 = .xxxy
 44 = 01 00 01 00 = .xyxy
 50 = 01 01 00 00 = .xxyy
 54 = 01 01 01 00 = .xyyy
 E4 = 11 10 01 00 = .xyzw (identity)

Opcode formatting

The opcodes are placed in the order of the bits in the control word: Varying loading (bit 5) will always come first if enabled, followed by texture sampling (bit 6), then uniform loading (bit 7), etc.

To encode the opcode for each enabled unit in the control word, start with bit 0 of the first word. Then, for each unit, append the opcode to the current word. If the opcode overflows the current word, then start at bit 0 the next one.

Note that, because the bits are numbered right-to-left but the words are numbered left-to-right, this means that the opcodes usually look "broken" when looking at the instruction word-for-word. For example, a varying load followed by some other opcode might look like this:

aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb bbAA ...

where the varying load opcode is actually: AA aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa

Note that bits 32-33 of the opcode "overflowed" into bits 0-1 of the next word.
Registers

It appears there are 6 vec4 registers actually used out of up to 12 possible, which are encoded as four bits in a control field. The last 4 registers are read-only, "pipeline registers" and are hardcoded as:

12 - Vec4 constant 0
13 - Vec4 constant 1
14 - Texture sampler result
15 - Uniform fetch result

Also, each of these registers can be divided into 4 scalar registers when used as scalar inputs or outputs, for 24 scalar registers and 16 read-only special registers, which are encoded as six bits in a control field. Furthermore, when these registers run out there is a larger number of "temporary variables", which can be read using the uniform/temporary fetch (bit 9) and written using the temporary write (bit 15). When writing to a vector register, you can specify a "write mask" or "output mask". Conceptually, all 4 components of the result are calculated, but only the components specified by the write mask are actually written to the register.

There also exists various "pipeline registers" (four of them listed above) which are only used within one particular instruction (i.e. within the pipeline) and are used as the inputs/outputs of various units. The pipeline registers can be grouped into:

    Constants
    Texture Sample registers
    Uniform fetch register
    ALU registers (^vmul, ^fmul or ^v0, ^s0)

00 mmmm dddd SSSS SSSS ANrr rr00 1000 1010

d - Destination Register
    Note: writing to register 15 discards the output (used for loading texture coordinates)
i - Varying Index
a - alignment
    It seems that varyings (floats) can be loaded in aligned groups of 1, 2, or 4.
    This specifies how many to load at once. Note that the alignment affects the addressing;
    for example, loading from an index of x at an alignment of 4 is equivalent to loading from 2*x
     and 2*x+1 at an alignment of 2.
    00 - no alignment (load 1 float)
    01 - alignment by 2 (load 2 floats)
    11 - alignment by 4 (load 4 floats)
A - absolute value input modifier
N - negate input modifier
r - input register
o - Offset register - vector part
    1111: no offset (0)
O - Offset register - scalar part
    Note: it seems the offset register is formed by ooooOO.
    However, I haven't been able to test this theory because I haven't gotten the compiler
    to produce a value for O other than 11. 
s - source:
    00pp - normal varying
    01pp - register (see second instruction format)
    1000 - varying, input to textureCube()
    1001 - register, input to textureCube()
    1010 - vec3 normalize (see third instruction format)
    1011 - gl_FragCoord
    1100 - gl_PointCoord
    1101 - gl_FrontFacing
S - swizzle descriptor for source
p - perspective (used for texture2DProj)
    00 - normal
    10 - divide by z
    11 - divide by w

Note: for gl_FragCoord and gl_PointCoord, the shader has to apply some transforms to get the right value.
For gl_FragCoord, it looks like this in pseudocode:
gl_FragCoord.xyz = gl_FragCoord_orig.xyz;
gl_FragCoord.w = 1.0 / gl_FragCoord_orig.w;

And for gl_PointCoord:
uniform vec4 gl_mali_PointCoordScaleBias; //created by the compiler
gl_PointCoord = gl_mali_PointCoordScaleBias.zw + gl_mali_PointCoordScaleBias.xy * gl_PointCoord_orig;

d - destination
m - mask (for destination)
a - scalar source
A - scalar modifier (negative, absolute value)
b - vec4 source
B - vec4 source swizzle descriptor

Note - for sin and cos, the input is multiplied by the constant 1/(2*pi), presumably to
simplify the hardware.

atan is divided into two instructions, which we'll call atan_pt1 and atan_pt2.
atan_pt1 takes the (scalar) input and produces a 3-component vector.
atan_pt2 takes the vector and produces the final output.

Unlike atan_pt1, you need to do an additional multiply between atan2_pt1 and atan_pt2:
$temp.xyz = atan2_pt1 y, x;
$temp.x *= $temp.y;
result = atan_pt2 $temp;

asin and acos are implemented using atan2, as follows:
asin(x) = atan2(x, sqrt(1 - x^2))
acos(x) = atan2(sqrt(1 - x^2), x)

atan_pt1:

dd ddmm mmaa aaaa AAbb bbbb BBoo oo01

    bit 1 - jump if a = b
    bit 2 - jump if a < b
   The jump will happen if any of the conditions signaled by the appropriate bit is true.
   For example, a condition code of 011 means "jump if a >= b" and 111 is an unconditional jump.

t - target address, relative to the start of the current instruction

control[17] and control[18], Vec4 constant fetch

This opcode simply consists of 4

to be loaded. bits 0-15 store the first argument, bits 16-31 the second one, etc.

Lima Fragment Pipeline

Vertex Shader

For more information on the disassembly/decompiling tools see Vertex+Disassembly.

The vertex shader has a scalar VLIW architecture. Each instruction has a field for 2 addition ALU's, 2 multiplication ALU's, a complex ALU, a passthrough ALU, an attribute load unit, a register load unit, a uniform/temporary load unit, and a varying/register/temporary store unit. Instructions are fixed-length - each instruction consists of 4 words. Constants are implemented internally by uniforms.

Unlike a normal CPU, there are no explicit output registers for the ALU's, nor are there any explicit input registers. Instead, the input field(s) for each ALU can directly reference the ALU results from previous instructions (see below). However, there are 16 registers that can be used when two instructions cannot be scheduled so that one references the result of the other (either directly, or through one or more passthroughs), or for special cases such as loops. Only one (4-component) register may be loaded & stored per instruction, and storing registers and temporaries shares some of the same fields as storing varyings.
Temporaries

Akin to the fragment shader, there are also temporaries, which unlike registers can be indexed using a base register/input. They share the same namespace and method of loading as uniforms. Storing temporaries uses the same fields as storing a register/varying does, except that the "temporary store flag" is enabled, the unknown field is changed, and the complex ALU is used to select the store address instead of the "varying/register store 0" and "varying/register store 1" fields, which are set to 0.
Output Transformation

gl_Position is implemented internally as a varying; it seems that it is hard-coded to varying 0. The compiler implements some transforms internally to convert the value calculated for gl_Position in the shader to the actual value sent to the hardware. In particular (in pseudocode):

uniform vec4 gl_mali_ViewportTransform[2];
gl_position_actual.w = clamp(1.0 / gl_Position.w, -1e10, 1e10);
gl_position_actual.xyz  = gl_Position.xyz * gl_position_actual.w * gl_mali_ViewportTransform[0].xyz + gl_mali_ViewportTransform[1].xyz;

gl_PointSize is also implemented internally as a varying. However, its position doesn't appear to be fixed. There are also some transforms involved:

uniform vec4 gl_mali_PointSizeParameters;
gl_PointSize_actual = clamp(gl_PointSize, gl_mali_PointSizeParameters.x, gl_mali_PointSizeParameters.y) * gl_mali_PointSizeParameters.z;

Complex functions

Complex functions are implemented using multiply ALU opcodes 1 and 3, as well as various complex ALU opcodes. The computation looks like this:

output = mul.op1(complex(input), mul.op3(input, input), complex(input), input)

for exp2, it looks like this (note the addition of pass.op4):

output = mul.op1(complex.exp2(pass.op4(input)), mul.op3(pass.op4(input), pass.op4(input)), complex.exp2(pass.op4(input)), pass.op4(input))

and finally for log2 it looks like this:

output = pass.op5(mul.op1(complex.log2(input), mul.op3(input, input), complex.log2(input), input))

it would seem that pass.op5 performs the opposite of pass.op4.
Inputs to the ALU's

These are the known inputs:

0-3:   Register 0 Output [0, current] (Register/Attribute)
4-7:   Register 1 Output [0, current] (Register)
8:     Unused, same as 21? (seen in m200_hw_workarounds.c nop shader)
9-11:  Unknown
12-15: Load Result [0, current] (Uniform/Temporary)
16,17: Accumulator 0,1 Output [-1, last instruction]
18,19: Multiplier 0,1 Output [-1, last instruction]
20:    Passthrough Output [-1, last instruction]
21:    Unused/nop (i.e. this ALU is not used during this instruction)
22:    Complex Output [-1, last instruction]
22:    Identity/Passthrough (0 for add, 1 for multiply)
         Accumulator 0,1 Input 1: add(a, -ident) means pass(a)
         Multiplier  0,1 Input 1: mul(a,  ident) means pass(a)
23:    Passthrough Output [-2, two instructions ago]
24,25: Accumulator 0,1 Output [-2, two instructions ago]
26,27: Multiplier 0,1 Output [-2, two instructions ago]
28-31: Register 0 Output [-1, last instruction] (Register/Attribute)

Note: If attribute_load_en is disabled then the attribute slot can be used to load registers too.
Latencies

Temporaries have a latency of 4 instructions, i.e. writes take 4 cycles to appear. Registers have a similar latency of 3 instructions. Writes to address registers 1-3 have a latency of 4 instructions. Writes to address register 0 (temporary store) have no latency though, so it can be set in the same instruction as the temporary store itself. The complex1 operation has a latency of 2 cycles.
